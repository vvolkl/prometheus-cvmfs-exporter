Description: Prometheus exporter for CVMFS client monitoring
 A Prometheus exporter for monitoring CVMFS (CernVM File System) clients.
 This package provides a script that collects metrics from CVMFS repositories
 and exposes them in Prometheus format, along with systemd service files
 for running the exporter as a service.
 .
 The exporter collects various metrics including:
  - Cache hit rates and sizes
  - Download statistics
  - Repository status and configuration
  - Proxy usage and performance
  - System resource usage by CVMFS processes
 .
 The package supports both legacy and modern CVMFS versions (>= 2.13.2)
 and provides configurable repository discovery methods.
